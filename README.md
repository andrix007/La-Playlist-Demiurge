# La-Playlist-Demiurge

## Before using:
* Exclude this project from your antivirus
* Create specific environment variables for SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID_SECRET
* Create Spotify playlist
* Copy your username link and the playlist's link and put them inside config.json
* Put the songs' links inside `PlaylistLinks.txt`

After that, run it, it will redirect you to an authentification page (so that it will be able to modify your playlist) and it will create a playlist with those songs :)!
